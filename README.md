# Module-6-Assignment

In this module assingment we were given 4 question that had some code already in it. The goal was to either reconfigure it or create it in order to do the fucntion that was being asked in the question. When first looking at the questions and seeing what was asking to be done, I was a bit confused. I went and watched the videos for this module and was still fairly confused. Then the email was sent out providing the answer to the first question. This helped tremendously in understanding what I needed to do. I was still confsued on some of the bits of code so I did have to look up how to do the second question and how to use datetime and timedelta and what was the right commands for it. I also watched videos on how to subtract time and add time and days working on python. Overall I think I had a lot of fun during this module and understand a lot more about adding tie and years and such in python. I also feel as though I have a better grasp in creating functions that have two arguments inside it also.
